## Test using http requests manually

Got the file [project]\src\main\java\ch\cpnv\es\payroll\Controllers\EmployeeDelete.java

Before all routes, you will find a curl sample.

## Run tests

```bash
mvn test
```

```bash
mvn -Dtest=EmployeeDeleteTest test
```

## Run the api with Docker

* Build the image

```docker
docker build -t ms-payroll-employees-delete:latest .
```

* How to run the test inside the container ?

The multi-stage Dockerfile integrates a test stage that prevents image creation unless all tests pass.

* Run the image

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name ms-payroll-employees-delete ms-payroll-employee-delete:latest
```
